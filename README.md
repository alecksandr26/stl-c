# Structure Library - C (stl-c)
**stl-c** is a C library designed to provide a set of structure-related functionalities for working with **static memory** and **dynamic memory**. Inspired by the **Standard Template Library (STL) of C++**, stl-c offers a collection of **generic template data structures and algorithms** that are optimized for static memory and dynamic memory, allocation and manipulation.
# Features
* **Generic Static Structures**: **stl-c** allows you to create generic data structures, enabling efficient utilization of memory resources while avoiding dynamic memory allocation.
* **Container Based Structures**: **stl-c** provides a collection of data structures built on container components. These containers, at their core, are implemented as arrays, offering **efficient storage and access to elements**.

# License
**stl-c** is released under the MIT License, allowing for free and open use in both commercial and non-commercial projects.
